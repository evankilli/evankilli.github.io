Hey! Thanks for visiting my website. My name is Evan Killion; I'm an urbanist, a New Englander, a photographer, a traveler, and many others. On the pages here, you can find out a bit more about my education and professional background in planning and transportation, some personal projects I've done outside of work, and some ways you can get in touch.

I was born and raised most of my life in Central Connecticut, with deep family roots in and ties to Philadelphia and a few years in Florida's Brevard County under my belt. Entering Middlebury College, my thinking about what made a "sense of place" led me to study Geography and take a particular interest in urban geography and other aspects of human geography. Since graduating, I've dedicated myself to building a career in planning, spending as much time with my many family members as I can, and dabbling in as many little skills and interests as I find the time for. After a stint learning the ropes as a Sustainable transportation Planning Intern with the City of Cambridge, I've worked at RSG, Inc. for more than three years, strengthening my skills in data analysis and outreach and taking on a range of projects focused on improving the quality of transit service, among others. Other hobbies include exploring recipes from my family's old cookbook, games of Magic the Gathering, talking about my Quidditch glory days, using cameras older than my parents, and reading on light rail.
