## Books that I am reading, have read, or will read - A work in progress!

Starting as an undergraduate, I encountered an unfortunate phenomenon familiar to many students: *I could not get myself to read for fun*. With pages on pages of literature (usually academic papers, but sometimes fiction or prose non-fiction) to read each week - which could be difficult to complete on its own - reading anything deeper than a Wiki page was the last thing I wanted to do at the end of the day. I can only remember reading two books on my own in my time in college ... Dan Brown's *Origin* and a YA novel, *They Both Die at the End*, both of which I read during particularly quiet periods (an Autotrain ride home to Florida and J-Term, respectively) that I needed to occupy.

Since graduation, though, I've slowly and surely been re-learning to love flipping through pages, immersing myself in another world, rethinking how I see society, or learning about some far away place I'll consider visiting once I'm officially a *DINK*. While not matching the voracity with which I read as an erudite middle schooler, I've built up some good endurance muscles and have made good progress at reading a solid handful-and-a-half of books a year. I've created this page to try and keep better track of what I've been reading, for my own posterity and maybe to get these books in my friends' laps too.
